# VideoProcessing
An App to unwrap images and videos taken with a BubbleScope

Based upon the BubblePix video converter. Incorporated into a new project with a basic UI and adapted to use Photo Library videos rather than files within the BubblesPix App

The metadata is added and the output video is recognised by Facebook as a 360Â° video



Known issues

The app currently uses fixed preset parameters which work for the TestVideo supplied

The metadata is not retained by the iOS photo library when using export to YouTube in the Photos App

If you run this in the simulator, it will run very slowly
